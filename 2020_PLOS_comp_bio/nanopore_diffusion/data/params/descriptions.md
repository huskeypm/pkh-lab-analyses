Descriptions and purpose of each of the parameter input files contained in the subfolders, by yaml file base name.

The human-readable hashes are calculated in `../../notebooks/hashes.ipynb`.

# brainy-media

Human-readable hash of `Figure of D_eff vs \phi`.

Used to generate figure of $D_eff$ vs $\phi$ for body-centered geometry.

# che580-sp18

Used as example input file for CHE 580 class demonstration in Spring of 2018.

# debug

Used for routine debugging of the code.

# exotic-earth

Human-readable hash of `Homogenization of 2D two-layer Fickian diffusion`.

For testing homogenized Fickian diffusion.
As yet not complete.

# ill-sleep

Human-readable hash of `Time-dependent PNP-reaction system for 2D geometry with Calcium binding to Calmodulin`.

A first attempt at a PNP-reaction simulation, with 2D geometry.
As yet not complete.

# notebook

Data file used for testing purposes while developing code.

Intended to be loaded only from the appropriate Jupyter notebooks,
not from `solver_run.py` or similar scripts.

# second-whole

Human-readable hash of `Multi-species Smoluchowski simulation with reactive sphere in the pore`.

This is the analysis Pete has asked Shashank and Hadi to work on.

# shashank

Example input files given to Shashank.

# test

Mesh only.
Contains body-centered and a face-centered mesh for the 3D nanoporous membrane problem.

# thin-shot

Human-readable hash of `D_eff vs \phi for Smoluchowski equation`.

Used to generate the figure of $D_eff$ vs $\phi$ for different pore electric potentials,
using the Smoluchowski equation.

# validation

Used for validation problems: simulate a system where the correct result can be obtained by other means.

# yummy-press

Human-readable hash of `Homogenization of spatially varying diffusion constant from molecular dynamics simulations`.

Used for simulations conducting homogenization with a spatially-varying diffusion constant taken from MD simulations.
