# Description

Source code and problem description document for FEM solution of diffusion problems at the nanoscale.

# Required Software

The FEM analysis is conducted using `FEniCS` (https://fenicsproject.org/),
using the python programming language (https://www.python.org/).

Meshes for the FEM analysis are generated using `gmsh` (http://gmsh.info/).

The FEM analysis and the generation of the problem description document
have been automated using a python package known as `doit` (http://pydoit.org/).
The analyses can be run without `doit`, so it is not required.

Many analysis parameters are stored in `yaml` format (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML).
A very brief introduction to the syntax can be found at https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/,
and its official site is http://yaml.org/.
The python package `pyyaml` (https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml) is used to read these files.

Some output files (such as `gmsh` .geo input files)
are generated using the `jinja2` template engine (http://jinja.pocoo.org/).

Some output data is stored in `pandas` DataFrame objects (http://pandas.pydata.org/).

`matplotlib` (https://matplotlib.org/) is used for generation of plots.

`scipy` (https://www.scipy.org/) is used only for unit conversions and physical constants.

Documentation of the code is set up to be compiled with Sphinx: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/.
__TODO__ what other software does sphinx require?
  - latex (listed below)
  - pandoc? (I think this was only if you used markdown)
  
The sphinx documentation is built by running the command `make latexpdf` from within the `sphinx` directory.

The problem description document requires the following software:

- `inkscape` (https://inkscape.org/en/)
- `pdflatex` (available with most distributions of `LaTeX`, https://www.latex-project.org/)
- python package `doit`, as described above.

The code is hosted in a `git` repository (https://git-scm.com/).

# Files and Folders

Otherwise empty directories (eg directories containing only untracked files or subdirectories)
will have a '.keep' file to force `git` to include the directory itself.

If defined, the environment variable `SRCLOC` will be used to locate the `src` folder.
Similarly, if the environment variable `DATALOC` is defined, it will be used to locate the `data` folder.

The various sets of analyses that have been conducted using the code are organized
by short, human-readable hashes of longer analysis descriptions.
The human readable hashes used here consist of an adjective followed by a noun.
Some readers may be familiar with the code names used for releases of the Ubuntu distribution of linux,
which uses this pattern as well.
The human-readable hashes here were generated using the python package `codenamize`
(https://github.com/jjmontesl/codenamize).
The code itself does not use this package, so it is not required
in order to run analyses or generate the problem description document.
And in some cases, the descriptions have been revised after the hash was generated.
The mapping between the current analysis descriptions and the
hashes is stored in `src/params/hashes.yaml`.

# Usage

__TODO__
- describe control.yaml and how it works with doit

Misc. things to note:
- the distinction between loading objects and actually running them:
  - generally, you could think of it as initialization reads in everything that needs to be read, and running is when output is actually generated
  - also, any quick and simple calculations can be done at initialization, but any time-consuming ones need to wait for running
  - for classes derived from common.ParameterSet, initialization gives all the information needed to create a task in doit, running actually performs the task
  - for classes derived from simulator_general.GenericSimulator, initialization stops just before asking FEniCS to solve the problem, running solves and generates output
- simulator_general defines base classes used by other simulator modules, and simulator_run uses those to define tasks and run analyses.
- how files are located (e.g. the `_folders` attribute, etc.)

Discuss how to use unitsystem.py
