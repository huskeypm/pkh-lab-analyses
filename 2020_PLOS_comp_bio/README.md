This folder contains the simulation code for the paper
"Co-localization and confinement of ecto-nucleotidases modulate extracellular adenosine nucleotide distributions"
published in June of 2020 in PLOS Computational Biology.

The base code using fenics is found in the `nanopore_diffusion` subdirectory.
The `electrolyte_analysis` folder contains some example scripts and input files used for testing and demonstration purposes, which were also the basis for the input files of the simulations reported in the paper.

The input files, scripts, notebooks, etc for the simulations that generated the data reported in the paper can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3711649 .
