Rosetta input files, MD starting structures, MD input files, analysis scripts, and ipython notebooks used in support of our CaM/MLCK modeling are available in this repository. 
We have provided roughly 2Gb of finalized simulation data at the DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8075316 (Zenodo).
Raw, full-length MD simulation data are also available by request and are redundantly stored on the Stritch School of Medicine computing center.


The paths to our data (on the internal network) are at
