## Intro 
Welcome, this repository hosts project files associated with each of our publications. For the most part, the files are ipython notebooks with requisite python modules.  In some cases, the notebooks will be reliant on data that we have stored on our local network for capacity reasons, so please feel free to contact us for these data if needed. Should a repository for a given paper be missing or if you have trouble running a script, please contact Pete Kekenes-Huskey (pkekeneshuskey@luc.edu)
