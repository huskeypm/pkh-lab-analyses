The final homogenization simulations were conducted using the information in the `chan6` folder,
using the FEM code in `simproc`, above.
Input data to the homogenization simulations came from the MD simulations.
Processing of the data from the MD simulations to prepare FEM input, and post-processing of the FEM output data, was conducted using the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder.
Some of these notebooks also drew from additional data sources included in the `chan3` and `silicate` folders.
