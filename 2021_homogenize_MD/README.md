This folder contains the source code and select input data for the simulations reported in the paper
"Homogenization of Continuum-Scale Transport Properties from Molecular Dynamics Simulations: An Application to Aqueous-Phase Methane Diffusion in Silicate Channels".

The contents are as follows:

- silicate_md: code for preparing input files for gromacs
- simproc: python code using Fenics to conduct FEM homogenization simulations
- singularity: recipes for singularity images containing the software needed to run the simulations
- sphinx: for building basic documentation of the simproc module using `sphinx`.

The input files generated from this data,
and the simulation output files,
are available upon request.
