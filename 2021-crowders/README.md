This folder contains the source code and select input data for the simulations reported in the paper
"Crowding within synaptic junctions influence the degradation of adenoside nucleotides by CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases".

The contents are as follows:

- simproc: python code using Fenics to conduct FEM simulations
- singularity: recipes for singularity images containing the software needed to run the FEM simulations
- sphinx: for building basic documentation of the simproc module using `sphinx`
- crowder_sims: example input files using the FEM code in `simproc`

The input files generated from this data,
and the simulation output files,
are available upon request.
