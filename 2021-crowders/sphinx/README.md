Information for using `sphinx` to build some basic documentation for the `simproc` code.

To build:

First, run `make clean`, to remove previous build attempts.

Then, run `make html` or `make latexpdf` for html or pdf documentation, respectively.
Some warnings are expected.

The `sphinx` software is included in the `complete` singularity recipe.
