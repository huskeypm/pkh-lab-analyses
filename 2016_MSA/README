##Note: there are also some mini and full length simulations of Mg-bound PV based on my initial attempts at overlaying 1RRO with 4PAL. These are located in $PREFIX_DIRECTORYtesting/. However, CES did a more advanced rotameric analysis for the Mg binding case in Chimera; those files can be found in:

##CES: INCLUDE YOUR MG BOUND SIMS HERE PLEASE AND REMOVE THIS COMMENT WHEN DONE.
